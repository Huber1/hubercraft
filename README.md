# Hubercraft Plugin

A papermc plugin for the Hubercraft server on [huber.party](https://huber.party)

## Features

### 1. SpawnIsland

When standing on the worldspawn, the player gets levitated to an island on the top where a one-time elytra is given.  
This helps Players to distribute across the map more easily

### 2. BeaconFly

When standing on an **active** beacon (directly or with one block space between) **and** having an elytra equipped, the
player gets a levitation effect.  
Depending on the level of the beacon (1-4), the player gets higher into the air. Max is ~150 Blocks (enough to travel
1500 Blocks)
