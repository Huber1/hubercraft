# Hubercraft Plugin

A papermc plugin for the Hubercraft server

## Features

### 1. SpawnIsland

When standing on the worldspawn, the player gets levitated to an island on the top where a one-time elytra is given.
See [SingleUseElytra](https://github.com/Huber1/SingleUseElytra)

### 2. BeaconFly

When standing on an **active** beacon (directly or with one block space between) **and** having an elytra equipped, the
player gets a levitation effect.  
Depending on the level of the beacon (1-4), the player gets higher into the air. Max is ~150 Blocks (enough to travel
1500 Blocks)

## TODO
- OneTimeElytra persist Armor on disk
- prevent levitation advancement when levitating through a beacon
